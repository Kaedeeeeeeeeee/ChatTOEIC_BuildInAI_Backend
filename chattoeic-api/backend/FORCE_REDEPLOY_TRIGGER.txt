ðŸš€ FORCE REDEPLOY TRIGGER - Oct 3, 2025 22:40 JST

CRITICAL: Railway is running version 2.0.0 but we need 3.4.0-TIMELIMIT-VALIDATION-FIXED

ISSUE: timeLimit validation error still occurs
ERROR: "timeLimit" is not allowed

FIX APPLIED: src/middleware/validation.ts line 93
timeLimit: Joi.number().integer().min(0).optional()

DEPLOYMENT STATUS: NEEDS FORCED REBUILD

This file forces Railway to detect changes and redeploy the latest version.

Expected result after deployment:
- Version should show 3.4.0-TIMELIMIT-VALIDATION-FIXED
- timeLimit parameter should be accepted
- TOEIC question generation should work
