ðŸ”¥ NUCLEAR REDEPLOY VERSION 3.0.0 - Oct 3, 2025 21:50 JST

CRITICAL: Railway is COMPLETELY IGNORING our updates!

Evidence:
- Local code: version 3.0.0-NUCLEAR-REDEPLOY
- Railway logs: version 2.0.0 (OLD!)
- timeLimit validation: STILL FAILING
- Database errors: vocabulary_items.sourceType missing

DEPLOYED FIXES THAT RAILWAY IS IGNORING:
1. âœ… timeLimit field added to validation.ts line 93
2. âœ… production-db-fix.js created with all missing columns
3. âœ… emergency-db-fix.js created for server startup
4. âœ… railway.json modified to run database fix first
5. âœ… package.json npm start modified to run fix

THIS FILE IS VERSION 3.0.0 - IF RAILWAY STILL SHOWS 2.0.0,
THE DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY BROKEN!

Manual intervention required:
1. Check Railway build logs for errors
2. Run emergency-sql-fix.sql manually in Railway database console
3. Restart Railway service manually
